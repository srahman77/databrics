Here we will learn on how to upgrade the databricks workload to UC. 
**Discovery and Scoping Phase**
This is probably most important phase of UC upgrade
* We start with Probing questions, Alignment and Scope setting
* We undertand the customer's expectations
* Agree on the deliverables
* Set scope of work that can be achieved within the project constraints- typically the amount of money and time alloted to the project.
* And we achieve the above by following tasks-
    1. Meet the releavant personnel
    2. Run UCX tool and review results
    3. Understand customer's pain point
    4. Understand customer's need
    5. Get to know stakeholders and their processes
