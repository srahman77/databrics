Here we will learn on how to upgrade the databricks workload to UC. 
**Discovery and Scoping Phase**
This is probably most important phase of UC upgrade
* We start with Probing questions, Alignment and Scope setting
* We undertand the customer's expectations
* Agree on the deliverables
* Set scope of work that can be achieved within the project constraints- typically the amount of money and time alloted to the project.

    1. Meet the releavant personnel: Should be done before the engagement start date. Here the requirements should be crystallised and the defination of success id agreed upon
    2. Run UCX tool and review results: This will help in discussion regarding the deliverables
    3. Understand customer's pain point: Regarding existing governance methodologies (in other project cases, existing system/flow)
    4. Understand customer's need
    5. Get to know stakeholders and their processes
* We should make sure a check list of pre-requisites-
     * Customers:
       1. No Hard blockers: Make sure no blockers from customer side that can derail the upgrade. e.g. in AWS, UC is not supported in single tenant databricks (needs E2). No such limitaions for Azure and GCP, but make sure if any new limitaion comes. Also, UC is supported in Premium and above. Standard tier does not support UC
       2. Identify administrator:

       4. Access to metastore:
       5. Idea of how permissions should look:
