# Optimize performance with caching on Azure Databricks:
* Azure Databricks uses disk caching (previously known as delta cache/DBIO cache) to accelerate data reads by creating copies of remote Parquet data files in nodesâ€™ local storage using a fast intermediate data format. The data is cached automatically whenever a file has to be fetched from a remote location. Successive reads of the same data are then performed locally, which results in significantly improved reading speed.
* Disk caching behavior is a proprietary Azure Databricks feature. This name change from delta cache/DBIO cache seeks to resolve confusion that it was part of the Delta Lake protocol.
* In SQL warehouses and Databricks Runtime 14.2 and above, the CACHE SELECT command is ignored. An enhanced disk caching algorithm is used instead.
* Disk cache vs. Spark cache: Azure Databricks recommends using automatic disk caching.
