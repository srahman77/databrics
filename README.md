Lets start learning github with databricks
Now lets pull the changes from github to databricks
Have created my first branch. Created it from databricks and it got reflected in github. Now will pull this changes to databricks local
The changes came to local. Now will push the changes to remote branch and then will commit it to main branch by creating a pull request in github as pull request cannot be raised in databricks
